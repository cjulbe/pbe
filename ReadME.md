# Puzzle 1
## Read a RFID tag with MFRC-RC522 module using Python

We need to enable the SPI Interface in order to use the Raspberry Pi since that's how our RFID reader circuit runs through.

### Libraries
For the purpose of this project we will be using the following library: https://github.com/pimylifeup/MFRC522-python.
To do so, we need to install some other libraries also:

`sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip`

`sudo pip3 install spidev`

`sudo pip3 install mfrc522`
